BURGER RESTAURANT
===============
* This program runs on a local server through node.js

* Burger Restaurant is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the "Burgers that are not devoured" part of the page.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has an "Eat it up" and "Delete" button. When the user clicks the "Eat it up" button it will move to the "Devoured" section of the page.  When they click "Delete" it will be removed completely.

* Burgers in the "Devoured" section of the page can be readded to the "Not devoured" section by pressing the "Get another" button, or deleted by pressing the "Delete" button.  

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
